<!-- HW-Wireframe Exercise -->

<!-- 
    Instructions

Create a new repository in GitHub called HW-Wireframe.
Clone this repository to your computer by following the process we went over in class.
Navigate to the HW-Wireframe folder you just cloned onto your machine. Then create two files inside this folder: index.html and style.css.
Make your initial Git commit and push it to GitHub.

git add .
git commit -m "<COMMENT>"
git push origin master
If this process was done correctly, you should see these two files appear in your repository. This will be your initial test to confirm that you're hooked into GitHub.

Return to your local copies of index.html and style.css. Using the screenshot at the top of these instructions, recreate the design using HTML/CSS.

All of your HTML should be inside of the index.html file.
All of your CSS should be inside of the style.css file.

When you finish the assignment, commit your changes with Git and push them into your GitHub repo. Remember:

git add .
git commit -m "<COMMENT>"
git push origin master
